;; my-listsum just sums recursively all elements of a list.

Note. For all function definitions involving set operations, the sets are represented
as lists. It is assumed that all lists do not have repeated elements due to the nature
of sets. Thus, no filtering is done to remove duplicates. No sorting is needed for
set operations, only element-uniqueness is requested to the usr to guarantee correct
results.
