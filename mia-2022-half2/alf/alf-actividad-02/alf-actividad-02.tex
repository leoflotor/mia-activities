Build a DFA $M_C$ that recognizes the regular language $C = \left\{w\ |\ w\ \text{has at least 3 $a$'s and at least 2 $b$'s} \right\}$ and has an alphabet $\Sigma = \left\{a, b\right\}$.

\begin{solution}
    To move forward with the solution of the problem, it is important to mention the following theorem:
    \begin{theorem}
        The class of regular languages is closed under the intersection operation.
    \end{theorem}

    Lets us assume that the language $C$ of the automaton $M_C$ is a regular language. In fact, \textit{a language is called a regular language if some finite automaton recognizes it}\footnote{Introduction to the Theory of Computation - Michael Sipser.}. The finite automaton $M_C$ and the langauge it recognizes, $C$, can be regarded as the intersection of two regular languages $A$ and $B$ corresponding to the automata $M_A$ and $M_B$, respectively. The regular language $C$ was divided to take advantage of the intersection theorem between regular languages and to ease its construction. The regular languages $A$ and $B$ can be expressed as,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{l l}
            A & = \left\{w\ |\ w\ \text{has at least 3 $a$'s}\right\}, \\
            B & = \left\{w\ |\ w\ \text{has at least 2 $b$'s}\right\}.
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    The diagram of the automaton $M_A$ is shown in \cref{fig:automaton_a}, and it is described by the 5-tuple $(Q_A,\Sigma,\delta_A,r_0,F_A)$ where
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{l l}
            Q_A & = \left\{r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3\right\}, \\
            F_A & = \left\{r_3\right\}.
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    The alphabet $\Sigma$ is the same for both $M_A$ and $M_B$. Additionally, the transition function has the same form, i.e., $\delta_I : Q_I \times \Sigma \to Q_I$ where $Q_I = Q_A, Q_B$. Similarly, the diagram of $M_B$ is shown in \cref{fig:automaton_b} and it is described by the 5-tuple $(Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_B, s_0, F_B)$ where,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{l l}
            Q_B & = \left\{s_0, s_1, s_2\right\}, \\
            F_B & = \left\{s_2\right\}.
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    The transition tables that describe $\delta_A : Q_A \times \Sigma \to Q_A$ and $\delta_B : Q_B \times \Sigma \to Q_B$ are:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{c c}
            \begin{array}[t]{c | c c}
                Q_A \backslash \Sigma & a & b \\
                \hline
                r_0 & r_1 & r_0 \\
                r_1 & r_2 & r_1 \\
                r_2 & r_3 & r_2 \\
                r_3 & r_3 & r_3
            \end{array} \quad & \quad 
            \begin{array}[t]{c | c c}
                Q_B \backslash \Sigma & a & b \\
                \hline
                s_0 & s_0 & s_1 \\
                s_1 & s_1 & s_2 \\
                s_2 & s_2 & s_2
            \end{array}
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}

    In the same way, the 5-tuple that describes $M_C$ is $(Q_C, \Sigma, \delta_C, t_0, F_C)$ has a set of states such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{l l}
            Q_C & = \left\{t_{i,j} = (r_i, s_j)\ |\ r_i \in Q_A \land s_j \in Q_B\right\}, \\
            & = Q_A \times Q_B\ . \\
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    The symbol $t_{i,j}$ was used to denote $t_{i,j} = (r_i, s_j)$ for convenince of use throughout this assignment.

    Also, the alphabet is the same as the one originally defined, and the initial state is now a 2-tuple $t_{0,0} = (r_0, s_0)$. On the other hand, the accept states, for the intersection, are given by
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{l l}
            F_C & = \left\{t_{i,j} = (r_i, s_j)\ |\ r_i \in F_A \land s_j \in F_B\right\} \\
            & = F_A \times F_B\ , \\
            & = \{r_3\} \times \{s_2\}\ , \\
            & = \{(r_3, s_2)\}\ .
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    In contrast with the accept states coming from the union of two regular languages, the accept states in the intersection are only those whose both elements in the 2-tuple also belong to accept states.

    Now, taking our attention to the transition function, it is defined as
    \begin{equation*}
        \delta_C\left((r_i, s_j),\ a\right) = \left(\delta_A(r_i, a),\ \delta_B(s_j, a)\right)\ ,
    \end{equation*}
    where $(r_i, s_i) \in Q_C$. Thus, it is possible to contruct the transition table based on the individual transitions from $\delta_A$ and $\delta_B$, as shown below:

                (r_3, s_2) & (r_3, s_2) & (r_3, s_2) \\
            \end{array}
        \end{equation*}

    $\therefore$ The resulting DFA $M_C$ is shown in \cref{fig:automaton_c} and it recognizes the regular language $C$ which was constructed as an intersection of the regular languages $A$ and $B$ from $M_A$ and $M_B$, respectively.
